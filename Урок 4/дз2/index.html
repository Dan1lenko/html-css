            Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel
            Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics
            Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In
            2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel
            Worldwide's parent company. Marvel started in 1939 as Timely
            Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become known as
            Atlas Comics. The Marvel branding began in 1961, the year that the
            company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles
            created by Steve Ditko, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and many others. Marvel
            counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as
            Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Wolverine, the Hulk,
            Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, Doctor Strange, Black Panther and
            the Punisher, such teams as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic
            Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and antagonists including
            Doctor Doom, Red Skull, Green Goblin, Thanos, Ultron, Doctor
            Octopus, Magneto, Venom and Loki. Most of Marvel's fictional
            characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe,
            with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
            characters are based in New York City.
